As a user who is sensitive to temperature
So that I can control the temperature
I want the thermostat to start at 20 degrees

As a user who is sensitive to temperature
So that I can increase the temperature
I want to put the thermostat up by 1 degree increments

As a user who is sensitive to temperature
So that I can decrease the temperature

As a user who is sensitive to temperature
So that I don't freeze my nipples off
